					I took a look at an old assignment of mine recently, a short few paragraphs for my very first, Introduction to Honors class. I was not sure what I would find. It has been five years since I wrote those words. I suppose I felt I may be nostalgic, harkening back to a simpler time, a time that my bright-eyed optimism was still fresh and untarnished. That is not so say I am not currently optimistic about my prospects in life. I have worked hard these last five years to obtain some degree, pardon the pun, of preparation for a life of work outside of education. The first time I will really be free of assignments and classes, yet constrained by the expectations and realities of a more adult life. Returning to the assignment, I did find that sense of nostalgia. 
					</br>
					</br>
					My former self certainly thought things would be a bit less of a challenge than they turned out to be. But I could also see some flaws in my past self. The writing was less involved, a lot brusquer, and I could tell that past me didn’t really want to be doing the assignment at hand. But I was younger then. I started my college experience earlier than most, at the age of 16, through an early entrance program. These five years have really allowed me to mature into who I am today, and I really do feel that Honors was a part of that. 
					</br>
					</br>
					Most of my classes at UW have been STEM oriented, but Honors really gave that interdisciplinary experience it is known for. The social sciences I know now are likely only because I took them for honors. I do think this has made me a better person because of it. Given me a rounder view of the world. Soften my edges, stop seeing the world as so black and white as a teenager often does.  And for that I am grateful that honors took me from a naïve optimist to a knowledgeable, content realist.  
					</br>
					</br>
					My ideal audience of this portfolio is those who similarly see shades of grey, and who tend to not put causes before people. I mean this in the sense that if you have a set idea of how the world does or should work, and are not willing to entertain other thoughts, you will likely not enjoy my portfolio. Here is my disclaimer. The papers enclosed here represent me in different times of my life. I explore out of the box ideas, but also my reactions and attempted analysis of movements from my own personal lens. I may not agree with everything I have said, or I may still agree strongly with certain parts, but all of this is my personal history that has shaped who I am now, and this portfolio is attempting to showcase my development as a person and a development of my ideas, and it deserves to be shown in some form or another. So what I hope from any reader is the ability to see my works, and realize they only represent a small piece of me, and to not to rush to judgement, positive or negative. I am much more than the sum of a few pieces of writing, but I hope I can offer a glimpse into that equation. 
					</br>
					</br>
					For looking into the future, I don’t have lofty goals. Get a job, do it well, enjoy my free time. My time here at UW I think has been best for enabling that. I have concrete skills, I look good on paper. Off paper, I feel the perspectives I have been exposed to have helped me see the world from multiple angles. I can understand the context of events around me, and can calmly assess them, instead of rushing to snap judgements. I feel I would be a rougher, more opinionated, more belligerent with my ideas person without my experiences. I know now everyone has their thought and it is better to discuss and ask questions than push around half formed ideals. That’s all I really need to be. Well informed, Thoughtful, and good at what I do.

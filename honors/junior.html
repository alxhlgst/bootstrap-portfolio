			Honors Experiences this year were an Honors section of ART 190, Intro to Drawing, three Quarters of Honors Physics, HONORS 394A: Comparative Ideology: Human Rights Movements,
			and JSIS 202, Cultural Interactions.
			</br>
			This year really exposed be to political and ideological thought, as well as the hard sciences, and I think really helped me understand the world better.
			</br>
			</br>
			Maybe physics will boost by CS chances, I thought. Perhaps differential equasions? (Which I did not perform well in) Realizing  my CS dreams were about finished after a few rejections,
			I began searching for a few last options. Maybe is I double with neurobiology, focusing on Brain-Computer Interfaces? Perhaps that interesting essay could do it. But alas,
			it was not to be. Around this point, I just had issues with motivation. Classes were not going as well as I envisioned, and I grew depressed for a time. Family troubles didn't help either, 
			with pestering to get a job or move out. I went to therapy, which helped, but what helped most was when I accepted I was not getting into CS, and looked towards a n alternate path. 
			HCDE was what I found, similar to CS, but with a bigger focus on the types of topics discussed in my Honors classes. A more well rounded alternitive.
			Two changes brought me out of my funk: Getting into HCDE, and getting a bussing job to get me out and about, nd bringing in some spending money.

					<h2>ART 190 Intro to Drawing</h2>
					<p>
						This class involved sitting around and improving my drawing abilities, from pencil to charcoal
						There was a certain relaxation in the class, sitting around and drawing for hours.
						Honors reflected an increased workload and pace.
						</br>
						An example of a piece of work: A Portrait of my brother in Charcoal:

					<h2>PHYS 122 H-Mechanics</h2>
					<p>
						Physics is hard. Calculus is hard. Honors Physics at twice the pace of a normal class is even harder. But I learned a lot about the mechanics of the world.
						It is good to have a concrete base of science in ones pocket.

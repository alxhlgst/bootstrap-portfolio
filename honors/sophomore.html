			Sophomore Year. Coming off a few quarters of bad Calculus classes, I was battered but hopeful about chances to get into Computer Science

				This class involved a deep dive into the mechanics of the internet, and how people interact with each other

					<h2>HONORS 232 A: Of Pirates and Piracy- From Morgan's Bluff to Redmond?</h2>
					<p>
						This class was fascinating. 
						Clark Speed was an eccentric professor, but in this class, I greatly expanded my concepts of Capitalism, Piracy, History, and Modern Society, 
						as well as growing a much more detailed vocabulary. 
						This was the first Honors class I took that really made me think differently, and I credit it to shaping many of the current thoughts I have today.
						</br>
						Three main papers were created for this class. 
						</br>
						</br>
						The first paper, <strong>Ignorance Is Power </strong>was an analysis of Treasure Island, and 
						how Jim Hawkins' ignorance of pirate life was his greatest strength against Long John Silver
						</br>
						</br>
						The second paper, <strong>Ship of Theseus </strong>explored the relationship between fetishization of ideas and copyright.
						I wrote it a few years ago at this point, so it's best to read it to understand it.
						
						</br>
						</br>
						 This third paper, <strong>Dimestone </strong>specifically talks about the role of capitalism, colonialism, and society. I am quite proud of this one.
						 It builds the idea that Capitalism is a cycle, and much like limestone, there are layers
						of societies and commerece that rise and fall, as economic niches are filled, structure collapses, and the cycle begins anew.
